title: "CVE-2008-2663 ruby: Integer overflows in rb_ary_store()"
date: 2008-06-20
description: |
  Multiple integer overflows in the rb_ary_store function in Ruby 1.8.4
  and earlier, 1.8.5 before 1.8.5-p231, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p230, and
  1.8.7 before 1.8.7-p22 allow context-dependent attackers to execute
  arbitrary code or cause a denial of service via unknown vectors, a
  different issue than CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2664, and CVE-2008-2725.

  NOTE: As of 20080624, there has been inconsistent usage of multiple
  CVE identifiers related to Ruby. The CVE description should be
  regarded as authoritative, although it is likely to change.'

title: refile Gem for Ruby contains a remote code execution vulnerability
date: 2015-04-15
description: |
  refile Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when input is not
  sanitized when handling the 'remote_image_url' field in a form, where
  'image' is the name of the attachment. This may allow a remote attacker
  to execute arbitrary shell commands.
